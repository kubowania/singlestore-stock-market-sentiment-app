# Singlestore App Boilerplate

**Attention**: The code in this repository is intended for experimental use only and is not fully tested, documented, or supported by SingleStore. Visit the [SingleStore Forums](https://www.singlestore.com/forum/) to ask questions about this repository.

This app was created to serve as a demo app for [create-singlestore-app](https://github.com/singlestore-labs/create-singlestore-app), but can be used standalone. It is a React + TypeScript + Express + SingleStoreDB Demo app. The app is started with a [boilerplate](https://github.com/covalence-io/barebones-react-typescript-express), and you can count with packages like MaterialUI, Formik, YUP, react-chartjs-2 and others. We have a REST API integrated with SingleStoreDB structure done for you. It has everything already configurated and integrated so you can start implementing your idea right away. Happy coding!
